# Pymaceuticals Inc. Data Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes the effect of various drug regimens on tumor volumes in mice. Using data from two sources: **Mouse Metadata** and **Study Results**. We perform an analysis to understand the impact of different treatments on tumor growth. Key findings are visualized using box plots, bar charts, and statistical analysis. Insights derived from the data aim to help researchers identify the most effective drug regimens for further study.
## Goals and Approach
The main goal of this analysis is to understand the relationship between drug regimens and tumor volumes, identify the most effective treatments, and summarize key statistics for each regimen. Through this process, we derive actionable insights that can inform future research decisions and drug testing protocols.
## Key Objectives:
1. Understand the structure of the data and clean it for analysis.
2. Provide summary statistics for tumor volumes across different drug regiments.
3. Use visual tools (e.g., box plots, bar charts) to compare drug efficacy and treatment distributions.
4. Calculate correlation between variables like mouse weight and tumor volume.
